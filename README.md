# Empirical-study-on-two-class-image-classification
This project mainly focuses on studying different color models like RGB, HSV, CCT, etc and simultaneously use them as features for classification of images into 2 classes. For now, the test-bed chosen is indoor and outdoor images which will thus serve as the two classes for the classification task.
